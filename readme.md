ReactJS Boilerplate by Dada
===========================

~~This is an opinionated ES6-ready ReactJS boilerplate setup that includes all
packages I generally start with when developing a new website.~~

This project is no longer being maintained and is outdated. If you want a great React boilerplate, try [Erik Rasmussen's react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example).
